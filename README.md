# bEtsy
[b]Etsy will be an online store where a wide variety of products can be listed and sold by any user. In this project we will focus on reinforcing the major components of Rails, Model Validation, as well as introducing some more complex logic such as user authentication.

## Project Learning Goals
- Core comprehension of:
  - Routes
  - Controllers
  - Models
  - Views
- User based application logic
- User authentication
- Agile practices
- Feature branch management with Git
- Group project ownership

## Guidelines
- Groups of three or four will collaborate in pairs or individually and will report to their assigned Project Manager (one of the instructors)
- Use a task manager like [Trello](http://trello.com) to track your team's efforts
- Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
- Use HTML/CSS to style your website

### Restrictions
- Do not use gems for user authentication (such as Devise)
- You must use oAuth for user authentication.  

## Getting Started
1. As a group decide on an app name (this may help lead the aesthetic)
1. As a group decide on a team name (this will amuse your instructors)
1. Have one person on your team fork/clone the project master as per usual
  1. Add all other team members as collaborators
  1. Each team member should clone the repo to their computer
1. Figure out your workflow for the project, re: Git and Task management
  1. Determine who will be the Stand Up Leader and Task Leader for the first week
1. Create a Trello board and ensure that all team members and instructors have access
1. Review the User Stories below and create Trello tasks to represent them
1. Slack your team name, app name, and link to your trello board to your Project Manager

## Expectations
Build an online system for listing, selling, reviewing, and buying a wide variety of products listed by multiple merchants.

### General Requirements
- Unit tests and/or specs for
  - Controllers
  - Models
  - Routes
- Test code coverage (using SimpleCov - remember me!)
  - 90% for all controller and model classes

### User Stories
#### Guest User (Unauthenticated)
As a guest to the website (not signed in) I **can**:

    - Mailing Address
    - Name on credit card
    - Credit card number
    - Credit cart expiration
    - Credit Card CVV (security code)
    - Billing zip code
- Purchasing an order makes the following changes:
    - Reduces the number of inventory for each product

    - Each item in the order with a quantity and line-item subtotal

    - DateTime the order was placed
    - The current status of the order

- Sign in to my merchant account using OAuth

As a guest I **cannot**:

#### Authenticated Users
As a signed-in user, I **can**:

    - name
    - description

    - photo URL
    - stock
- Assign my products to any number of categories
- Retire a product from being sold, which hides it from browsing
- View an account page to edit/update my existing products
- View an account page showing my order fulfillment
- On the order fulfillment page:
    - Total Revenue
    - Total Revenue by status
    - Total number of orders by status
    - Filter orders displayed by status
    - Link to each individual order
    - A list of orders including at least one of my products:
        - Each order item sold by me with a quantity and line-item subtotal
        - A link to the item description page
        - DateTime the order was placed
        - Link to transition the order item to marked as shipped
        - The current status of the order ("pending", "paid", "complete", "cancelled")
- View an individual order to see the user's:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Mailing address
    - Last four digits of their credit card
    - Credit card expiration date

As a signed-in user, I **cannot**:

- Review my own products
- View order items from a shared order that belong to another merchant
- View another users private data (i.e. order fulfillment or product management)

### Model Validations
Many of our models will have attributes that are required for our application to use and display data consistently. Each model will have attributes with requirements for a valid record. The requirements are summarized below:

#### Merchant
- Username must be present

- Quantity must be greater than 0

#### Review

## Submission Guidelines
Your final project must be deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Your team will open a single pull request for the entire project. Include the link to your Heroku deployment in the PR's description, as well as the team name and the names of all members.

## Team Leaders
Each team will have team leaders who are responsible for keeping track of each team member's contributions. Rotate leader roles at the beginning of each week; every team member should be in at least one leader role during the project.

- Stand Up Leader
  - Notifies team members about meeting schedule and ensures that everyone is present and ready
  - Takes notes about each person's daily report in Stand Up
  - Keeps the meeting moving
- Task Leader
  - Leads discussion on task assignment
    - Decide if a task should be completed alone or in a pair
    - Assign tasks based on...
      - Individual comfort
      - Desire
      - Ability
  - Ensures the task list stays up to date

## Stand Up Meetings
The Project Manager for your team will determine the timing for all Stand Up meetings. Because PMs are managing multiple projects at once this time will be different for each team, and may change from day to day. The meeting schedule will be communicated to the Stand Up Leader as soon as it is determined.

At the end of each day, your team's assigned Project Manager will review the Trello board for all tasks discussed during that day's Stand Up meeting.

## Weekly Demos
In a real world work environment, a team's success is measured by their product as opposed to each individual's contribution.

Each team will present their progress and respond to questions from their Project Manager each Friday. Every team member will participate in these demos; the PM will ask specific questions regarding
1. The team's progress and plan for completing the project
1. The technical decisions and implementation
1. Every team member's understanding of the underlying technical structures.
